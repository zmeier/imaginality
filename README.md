# imaginality
Simple paint application that can be run by cloning this repository and opening the index.html file in a browser.
See it in action with AWS <a href="https://d3n9r7wd9u4svh.cloudfront.net/" target="_blank">here</a>. IE and Edge appear to have some difficulties with the current implementation, use Chrome or Safari for best experience.
